# Product-Page
A product page project that I've gotten from my time learning using freecodecamp. The design is going to be based off of 8bitdos main page, with a bit of improvements.

technologies that will be used
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

The two main goals of this project is to have something to put on my portfolio as a project I made, and to practice using bootstrap.
